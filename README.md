Vasar's Practice in Dragonfly

## A bit of context

This is Vasar DF, a project with the sole intent of remaking the PocketMine Vasar but, well, in Dragonfly.

Released early May, it was severely rushed and thus this code is not a great sight. Unfortunately, the project wasn't a
success either (hence why this is now open source), because the PvP community is extremely picky and is used to how
movement (and as a result, PvP style) works on PocketMine.

As such, we all decided to end the project and make it open source.
